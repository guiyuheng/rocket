4 extras effects have been done


1 randomised terrain generation: each time the game is played the terrain is different
2 wrap around terrain: when a player goes to a left or right game boundary instead of being blocked they will pass through to the opposite side of the game field
3 sounds effects: crashes, landings, rocket/thruster fire
4 new graphics: new space craft models and new terrain textures
